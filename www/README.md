# 4TeamFantasy

4TeamFantasyÂ© is a mashup of traditional
fantasy football and game picking.

We divide the season into four quarters
and pick 4 new teams for each quarter of
the season.

Instead of drafting players and setting a
lineup each week, you draft teams and
pick whether they win or lose each week.

If your pick is correct, you get 25 points.
However, if you are wrong, you lose
25 points.

Since you can pick your teams to lose in
this game, the worst teams in the league
are just as valuable as the best teams.

Prizes and payouts for each quarter and
end of season.
